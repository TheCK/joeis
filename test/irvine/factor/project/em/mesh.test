# Euclid-Mullin graph.
#
# This file contains the graph G1 defined in http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03039
# and was generated by irvine.factor.project.em.Mesh
#
# The graph essentially encodes all instances of Euclid's proof of the
# infinitude of primes.
#
# Factors contributed by Sean A. Irvine, Andrew R. Booker, Oscar Ostlin
# and others from mersenneforum.org.
#
# The graph is represented here as a tree with leading dots indicating
# the depth of a node from the root.  The node values are implicit, the
# value of a node is the product of all the given numbers (the edges if
# you like) on the path to the root.
