# Factorizations of Euclid-Mullin sequence starting with 39779.
# Each term of this sequence is 1 + the product of the least prime factors of
# all preceding values.  Thus to determine the sequence it is sufficient to
# find the smallest prime factor of each term.  However, here we list as much
# of each factorization as is known.
